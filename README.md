**Store Code Management (SCM) allows us to:** <br />

+ Store our code to a remote repository <br />
+ Collaborates with other developers working on the same code base <br />
+ Audit the source code history, restore our code to a point in time, recover deleted files. <br />
+ Work on concurrent branches <br />
+ Merge between branches <br />
